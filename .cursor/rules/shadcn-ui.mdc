# shadcn UI Component Library

This project uses **shadcn UI** for all UI elements and components.

## Setup

If shadcn UI is not initialized in the project, use:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Adding Components

When a particular component is not installed, use the following command (replace `button` with the desired component name):
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Guidelines

- **Always use shadcn UI components** for UI elements instead of creating custom components from scratch
- Check if a component exists in shadcn UI before implementing custom solutions
- Follow shadcn UI's styling patterns and component composition
- Use shadcn UI's built-in variant systems for component customization
- Reference the [shadcn UI documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for available components and usage patterns

- `button` - For interactive buttons

- `card` - For content containers
- `dialog` - For modals and popups
- `dropdown-menu` - For dropdown menus
